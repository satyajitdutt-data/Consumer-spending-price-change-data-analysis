This set of Python notebooks shows the entire end-to-end data pipeline that was used for the analysis of the research paper
Bachmann et al. (2023) "A Temporary VAT Cut as Unconventional Fiscal Policy" 

See https://bfi.uchicago.edu/insight/finding/a-temporary-vat-cut-as-unconventional-fiscal-policy/ 

Goal: To create a data frame that has one record per household and most importantly aggregates all point-of-sale FMCG expenditures of German households 
in the 2nd half of 2020. Our original file is a CSV file that contains millions of point-of-sale transactions of FMCG goods by German households from the
German market research firm, GfK. 

Summary: The 3% cut in the VAT led to ao 36% increase in durable spending for individuals with a high perceived VAT pass-through, along with an increase in 
semi- and non-durable spending; in addition, aggregate consumption spending rose by 34 billion Euros.
