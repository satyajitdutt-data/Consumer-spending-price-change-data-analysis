This repository consists of a dashboard that summarises the fast moving consumer good (FMCG) expenditure behaviour of German households in the 2nd half of 2020 (2020 H2) as a result of the 3% VAT cut imposed by the German govt. This was computed using over 30 million point of sale transactions of FMCG goods of over 8000 households by the German market research firm, GfK. The key insights are: 
- Median expenditure increased by 3 euros per supermarket visit in 2020 H2 vs 2019 H2 
- Households experienced an overall median drop of 2.4% in their FMCG price basket
- 65% of these households surveyed in 2021 January perceived that overall prices fell in 2020 H2 

In addition, this repository consists of a set of Python notebooks shows the entire end-to-end data pipeline used for the dashboard above. The goal was to create a data frame that has one record per German household with the computed FMCG price basket. 

The data in this paper was also used in the academic research paper in [Bachmann et al. (2023)](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/insight/research-summary/a-temporary-vat-cut-as-unconventional-fiscal-policy/)
